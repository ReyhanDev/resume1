    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>You are reading my first attempt to do a Capstone project as a Front-End development trainee.<br />
        I just finished the HTML-related modules and this is what I can make with what I've learned.<br />
        there is not much to say for now so please understand why the following sections are<br />
        filled with long "not really related" information.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p> I got my bachelor's degree in health information technology at the Kerman University of Medicine.<br />
        My education is about health system technologies and is almost unrelated to programming.<br />
        well, we had some programming courses coding with C++ and I learned nothing. Now I'm taking<br />
        an online course named "Udemy - The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" and hope to finish it in 44 days.
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Obviously, I have no programming work experience so here are some of my unrelated job positions:
        <ul>
            <li>Cashier at Hanna cosmetic shop for about 1 year</li>
            <li>Officer of virtual education at KMU for 2 years</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>"What does Skill mean?" I asked myself. after a minute I decided to google it and came across a page from<br />
        <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-are-skills">www.indeed.com</a> that says knowledge, ability, and competence are the qualities known as skill.<br />
        What I can say now is that I have none. ( ._.) But after 44 days there is a huge difference, I'm sure. \(^-^)/
    </p>
    <h2>Awards</h2>
    <p>Well, It's better to keep this one short and say "NOTHING".T-T</p>
